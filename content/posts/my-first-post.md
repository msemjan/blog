# Introduction

Welcome, dear reader.

So, I've just made my blog. I've decided to use Hugo to build it, because writing Markdown is easy, and it does not get in your way.

I've decided to start a blog for a couple of reasons:
- As an outlet for my creative writing
- To improve my technical writing
- For sharing my knowledge
- As well as a documentation of my journey as a programmer/developer

I've been writing before, but those were just personal notes that I haven't shared with other people.
