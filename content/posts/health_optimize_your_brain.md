# Optimize Your brain

## Introduction

People take care of their skin, their appearance and their fitness, but often neglect their brains. Brain health routine should be an important part of your day that can be used to combat cognitive decline with age, improve focus, reduce brain fog, and generally increase your performance. A popular youtuber Ali Abdaal in his video [1] sums up several evidence-based trick and tips that can help your brain, and I've decided to make notes in a written form as a reference.

## Food

What we eat has a big impact on our health in general, and when it comes to brain, it's no different. In the average adult human, the brain represents only about 2% of the body weight, but despite its small size it accounts for about 20% of the oxygen and calories consumed by our bodies. Our brains and guts are connected and they constantly communicate. Therefore, the first thing we should do to improve our brain health is to improve our diets.

What to avoid? The so-called Western diet, which is high in fat and refined sugar, reduced complex carbohydrate and fiber intake is a large and negative shift from older diets, which were high in complex carbohydrates and fiber, and it is basically a poison for our brains - it is detrimental to the brain, impairs cognition, and increases AD pathologies. Moreover it leads to increased risk of cardiovascular diseases and obesity.

The Mediterranean diet composed of polyunsaturated fatty acids, polyphenols, and antioxydants is considered to be neuroprotective. It is also linked to other health benefits, such as reducing risk of diabetes and cancer, improved memory, lower risk of dementia, and other neurodegenerative issues.

**Things to avoid**
- Highly processed food
- Sugars, sugary drinks and sweets

**Things to eat**
- Vegetables and leafy greens (especially spinach, kale, beet and turnip tops, chard and collards when in season) - 90% to 100% of diet should be plant-based
- Pickled and dried vegetables (off season) - e.g. beans, greens, sweet potatoes, whole grains, fruit, nuts and seeds
- Olive oil (increases good cholesterol, and lowers bad cholesterol)
- Fish
- Lentils
- Tofu
- Chickpeas
- Eggs
- Oatmeal
- Avocados
- Plant-based foods

**Supplements**
- If you can not get all your nutrients from the Mediterranean diet
- Omega 3 Oils
- Key vitamins, such as A, B Complex, C, D, E, etc.

## Body

Body and brain affect each other in ways which can be surprising. Among humans, regular exercise has a beneficial impact on depression, quality of sleep, and cognitive function. Basically, the exercise positively changes the structure of your brain.

This happens because of the protein called BDNF (Brain-derived Neurotrophic Factor), which is involved in key brain functions such as learning, memory, and higher thinking. It also modulates pathways responsible for the structure of the brain. Some studies shown increased levels of BDNF and other growth factors, which stimulate neurogenesis, increase resistance to brain insult and improve learning and mental performance.

The amount of produced BDNF is a function of volume (intensity + duration + frequency of activity). It also turns out that open-skills (such as badminton, football, or other sports) increase BDNF levels more than closed-skills exercises (e.g. running, or some other repetitive exercise), probably because open-skill activities require more attention to face ever-changing situations, and possibly because they are more enjoyable.

So it is a really good idea to move and exercise.

## Sleep

Continued sleep deprivation leads to various deficiencies. Not only it makes you feel terrible and sluggish, it also increases risk of obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, depressions, and even early death. At a more advanced level, sleep deprivation can over-stimulate parts of the brain and even lead to permanent brain damage and negatively affects your ability to adapt to new situations. Most sleep experts agree that the high quality sleep is the best single thing you can do to improve your performance.

## Exercising the Mind

You can (and should) train your mind, just like your body. Especially at older age.

In case of damage, brain can reorganize and fix itself, even in adulthood. This ability is called "neuroplasticity" and it is defined as an ability of neuronal networks in the brain to change through the development and organization of neural circuits. In other words, it can rewire itself.

This can make a difference. The way you can trigger the neuroplasticity at any age is by challenging yourself and your brain. This can be done using brain games, musical training, and learning languages. These activities lead to improved attention, memory, increased neural connectivity, and processing speed. Some studies even claimed the reduced risk of cognitive decline for older adults in the long term.

Another thing that can decrease risk of dementia and cognitive decline is continuous learning. So, maybe read a book, or work on some project that requires you to learn new things.

## Lifestyle

The healthy lifestyle is built on top of morning routines, diets, and healthy habits. You can either do healthy things or avoid unhealthy ones. Of course, you can try to do more activities or habits that have positive benefits, or you can avoid ones that are not good for you. For example, alcohol is a very common substance that is present in the lives of westerners, but nobody questions it's effect on health. A 2018 study found that alcohol use was biggest factor for dementia. Even one drink per day can allegedly shrink your brain. Complete abstinence would be perfect, but you will get the benefits even if you reduce drinking to 1-2 drinks per week.

However, there is some evidence that suggest positive benefits of red wine (in moderation) on your heart. The substances such as resveratrol, a substance that can be found in red wine, and antioxidants may help prevent coronary artery disease that leads to heart attacks. Red wine is also fairly common in Mediterranean.

The last thing that seems to be very important are social interactions. Humans are after all social animals, and being social, especially at older age, can reduce the risk of dementia and cognitive decline. Hang out with family, go on a date, party with friends, etc.

## Conclusion

Taking care of brain health is important for improving the general quality of life and preventing mental deterioration in later age. In this post I've summed up general strategies that positively affect brain health. They can be summarized as: eat healthy food (Mediterranean cuisine), perform some physical activity (frequently), sleep well, train your mind, quit/reduce alcohol consumption, and have a healthy lifestyle with a lot of quality social interactions.
