Hello, dear readers ðŸ™‚

Welcome back to my blog and I wish you happy 2025!

After a longer break I return, rested, full of energy, and ready to start writing again. I know that I was fairly inconsistent when it comes to the new posts, but I would like to change it in 2025. I already have some plans for this year, and would like to share them with you in this blog post.

When I [started this blog](./my-first-post.md), I mostly wanted to document my progress and share the things that I've learned along the way. In this year I would want to learn (and write) about the following topics:

- **Kubernetes**:
  - How to install Kubernetes on Raspberry Pi
  - Usage of kubectl
  - How to create basic deployments & services (basically how to transform my existing Docker Compose setup into a Kubernetes one)
  - How to use Helm for deployments
- Monitoring applications with **Graphana** and **Prometheus**:
  - Deploying Graphana and Prometheus using Docker and Kubernetes
  - How to integrate Go applications with Prometheus
  - Sending data from Prometheus into Graphana
  - Creating charts with data in Graphana 
- **Caddy** (HTTPS Server):
  - Replace my Nginx setup with Caddy
  - How to setup reverse proxy and load balancing
  - How to setup automatic HTTPS with Caddy
  - Metrics with Prometheus
- **Rust**:
  - I also consider jumping on the hype train and learning Rust, but maybe I'll not learn it (we will see)

Moreover, I would also like to write about my random experiments, and even things that I'll learn for work this year. Since my career kind of changed trajectory, you can expect that I'll write more about DevOps and various AWS services. I hope you are as excited for the upcoming blog posts as I am. 

And that's all I've got for today.

Thanks for reading, I wish you a wonderful day, and see you in the next one! ðŸ™‚
