I am Marek, a software developer from Slovakia ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡°

Programming and quantum mechanics are closest we can get to magic in real world. I was always drawn to the magical side of the nature, and because of this I've decided to study these subjects. For a quiet some time I was contemplating whether I should choose computer science, software engineering or natural sciences. When I was approximately nine, I've decided to study (computer) physics, because it allowed me to combine the two interests.

During my education I've learned several numerical methods, including Monte Carlo methods, and I've been using Metropolis algorithm to study frustrated magnetic systems. In the year 2019 I've earned my Master degree in theoretical physics at Pavol Jozef Å afÃ¡rik University in KoÅ¡ice. After that I've decided to continue my education. I've been still trying to solve the mysteries of frustrated Ising antiferromagnets, but I've learned new tricks, and even got an opportunity to teach problem solving sessions.

In the August of 2023, I've finished my PhD study.

Currently I am employed as a back-end developer in my home town. My company uses Java (with Sprint Boot), Maven, Python (mostly for tests), Javascript/Typescript, Github Actions, Terraform, Ansible, SQL, Elastic Stack, and many other technologies that I can not think of right now. Some of our code is in AWS Cloud.

I am interested in science and technology, which I would like to feature on this blog in the future. I would like to use this platform both for documenting my progress, and (hopefully) helping others learn.
