      <description>I am Marek, a software developer from Slovakia ðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡°
Programming and quantum mechanics are closest we can get to magic in real world. I was always drawn to the magical side of the nature, and because of this I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to study these subjects. For a quiet some time I was contemplating whether I should choose computer science, software engineering or natural sciences. When I was approximately nine, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to study (computer) physics, because it allowed me to combine the two interests.</description>
